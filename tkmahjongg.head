BACKGROUND
       I shamelessly swiped the core of the game from  xmahjongg.
       This includes the board,  tiles,  and documentation ;^) In
       fact, the only reason I wrote this was for the "undo  last
       move" and "flash matching tiles" features (I'm  not a very
       good mahjongg player). I apologize in advance to those who
       feel that these features are philosophically repugnant.

       Well,  there is one other reason I wrote it:  to get it to
       work under Windoze...  I apologize in advance to those who
       feel that  this feature is  morally and/or philosophically
       repugnant.

DESCRIPTION
       Mah  jongg  is  an  ancient chinese game usually played by
       four players  with tiles similar  to dominos. This is a TK
       version  for  the  solitaire  game.  If  you  have  played
       xmahjongg, this version will be very familiar to you.

THEORY OF PLAY
       The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the
       board.  Tiles are removed in  by  matching  two  identical
       tiles  which  have  either an open left edge or open right
       edge.  The only exception to this rule is  that  any  open
       "flower"  tile  (bamboo,  orchid,  plum, or chrysanthemum)
       matches any other open "flower" tile and any open "season"
       tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other
       open "season" tile.

       The display has two distinct areas: the playing field  and
       the control field.

       The bottom area is the playing field.  To remove a pair of
       tiles, click the left mouse button on a tile  (which  will
       light up)  and  then  click the left  mouse button on  the
       matching tile. At this  point, both  tiles will  disappear
       from the board. If after selecting  the  first tile,   you
       decide  that  you  don't wish  to play  that tile,  simply
       reclick the left button  on the tile, or  click  the third
       mouse button anywhere on the playing field.

       When a tile is selected, clicking the middle  mouse button
       or pressing  the "Shift" key and  clicking the right mouse 
       button   causes  all  matching  playable  tiles  to  flash
       briefly.  Pressing the "Control" key  and clicking  either
       the  middle  or right  mouse button  with a  tile selected
       causes all  matching tiles  to flash,  regardless of their
       playability or visibility.

       The  top  area is the control field.  The board number and
       the number of remaining tiles are on the right side of the
       board.   The  left  side has some buttons  for controlling
       the game. To select a button,  click the left mouse button
       on it.

INVOCATION
      On  UNIX systems,  change the first  line of tkmahjongg  to
      point  to  your  wish  executable,  set execute  permission
      for tkmahjongg,  and place it  somewhere in your PATH.  You
      can then run it with:

                tkmahjongg [options]

      Under Windows, you can start tkmahjongg with:

                wish8.0 tkmahjongg [options]

      Of  course  you  should change "wish8.0" to  whatever  your
      wish executable is called.

OPTIONS
      tkmahjongg  supports  a  number  of  command-line  options:

           [-b #]                 Choose game # (0-99999)
           [-c]                   Color tiles by group not level
           [-geometry geom]       Set window geometry to geom
           [-i]                   Start iconified
           [-l /path/to/file]     Load xmahjongg layout file
           [-r]                   Reverse fg/bg colors
           [-vb]                  Visual bell (not audible)

      If you  use the -geometry option,  do not  specify a window
      size. For example, the following is fine:

                tkmahjongg -geometry +20+20

      but the following won't work right:

                tkmahjongg -geometry 640x480+20+20

      Near  the top  of the  tkmahjongg script  are a  number  of
      other  parameters that  you may wish  to adjust,  including
      fonts, colors, etc.
